    <h3>Decentralised Identity and Biometric Authentication in Smart City Applications</h3>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h3>Session Topic and Scope</h3>
    <p>
      The evolution of smart cities is redefining urban infrastructure through the integration of intelligent systems in transportation, governance, healthcare, financial services, and public safety. At the core of these services lies biometric-based authentication and access control, enabling seamless, secure interactions between citizens and digital systems. However, current implementations primarily rely on centralised architectures, which aggregate and process biometric and identity data through centrally managed machine learning models. While centralisation simplifies system management, it introduces a range of critical security, privacy, and interoperability concerns. The reliance on centralised biometric repositories creates significant vulnerabilities, as evidenced by the exposure of over 1.1 billion biometric records in 2022 across multiple sectors. According to IBM’s 2023 Cost of a Data Breach Report, incidents involving biometric and personal data incur some of the highest costs, averaging $4.45 million per breach. Furthermore, a global survey conducted by Accenture revealed that 87% of citizens are concerned about the handling and storage of their biometric data within centralised systems, indicating a growing trust deficit.
    </p>
	
   <p> 
From an architectural standpoint, centralised machine learning systems face limitations in cross-domain interoperability, scalability, and real-time responsiveness - capabilities that are essential for interconnected smart city ecosystems. Challenges such as data silos, inconsistent standards, latency in authentication processes, single points of failure, and regulatory compliance barriers further impede the effectiveness and resilience of these systems. These challenges collectively underscore the pressing need for a decentralised, privacy-preserving identity framework that enables secure, scalable, and interoperable biometric authentication. Emerging technologies such as blockchain and federated learning offer promising solutions by decentralising identity management, enhancing privacy through local data processing, and enabling cross-sector collaboration without compromising data sovereignty.

This special session aims to address these challenges and explore cutting-edge research and practical implementations that leverage decentralized technologies to enhance the trust, transparency, and resilience of biometric systems in smart cities.
